## 🌍 Who we are

This organisation brings together the research lines of the **Climate and Planetary Change Hub** and **AIRLAB** at [ISGlobal](https://www.isglobal.org/).

We work across scales:

- From **planetary change** and climate tipping points to regional extremes, ecosystems and populations  
- Down to the **chemical and biological composition of the air**, including aerosols and bioaerosols in indoor and outdoor environments  
- And out to the **health impacts** on infectious and chronic disease, water and food security, urban environments and vulnerable communities  

Our aim is to generate rigorous, policy relevant and open climate and health evidence.

---

## 🔬 What we work on

### Planetary change and climate impacts

- Climate variability, extremes and long term change  
- Tipping points, ecosystem resilience and adaptation  
- Impacts on human health, water and food security, migration and conflict  

### Ecosystems, biodiversity and infectious disease

- Ecosystem change and zoonotic spillover  
- Climate driven shifts in vector and reservoir distributions  
- Emergence and spread of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance  

### Air, aerosols and bioaerosols

- Chemical and biological characterisation of indoor and outdoor air  
- Monitoring and analysis of aerosols and bioaerosols, including airborne microbiomes  
- Performance evaluation of air quality sensors and instruments  
- Technical and methodological support for air sampling and air quality studies  

### Data science and health analytics

- Climate services for health, including early warning and forecasting systems  
- Planetary health data science, spatiotemporal modelling and risk mapping  
- Workflows for linking climate, environment and health data across scales  
- Interactive dashboards and tools for researchers, public health agencies and cities  

---

## 🧪 Methods and infrastructure

Our work combines:

- **Observations and experiments**  
  - Laboratory characterisation of air samples, including cultivation and DNA extraction of airborne microorganisms  
  - Evaluation of sensors and instruments for air quality and aerosol monitoring  
  - Microscopy, molecular biology and chemical analysis platforms  

- **Models and analytics**  
  - Statistical and mechanistic models for climate, exposure and health outcomes  
  - High resolution geospatial workflows and remote sensing  
  - Time series and scale dependent methods for extremes and complex systems  

- **Computation and reproducibility**  
  - Reusable pipelines for climate and health data  
  - Containerised environments and continuous integration  
  - Reproducible reports and documentation with Quarto and related tools  

---

## 🧰 Tech stack

You will often see:

- **Languages**  
  Python, R and other scientific computing tools  

- **Analysis and modelling**  
  Time series and extreme value methods, machine learning, Bayesian and hierarchical models  

- **Geospatial and climate**  
  Climate and reanalysis data, remote sensing, GIS workflows, urban form and land use  

- **Lab and sensor data**  
  High throughput sequencing outputs, microscopy data, sensor networks and air quality datasets  

- **Reproducible research**  
  Quarto, Docker, GitHub Actions and open data whenever possible  

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

We collaborate with:

- Climate scientists, epidemiologists, ecologists and social scientists  
- Public health agencies, cities and international organisations  
- Technical partners on sensors, digital twins and climate services for health  
- Local communities and stakeholders in highly exposed settings  

We welcome:

- Issues with bug reports or feature suggestions  
- Pull requests that improve code, documentation or reproducibility  
- Ideas for tools that could help others work at the climate and health interface
